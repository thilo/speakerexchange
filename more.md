- Connect speakers that like to present their topic to other user groups with local organizers and prospect sponsors to get support for travel expanses.
- Encourage underrepresented groups to present abroad by funding their trips.
- Build speaker confidence by giving inexperienced speakers the opportunity to talk to a international audience before appearing at big conferences.
