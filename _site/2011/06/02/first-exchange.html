    <p>&#8220;The World is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.&#8221; &#8211; Saint Augustine</p>

<p>In June Martin Rehfeld, member of the <a href='http://rug-b.de'>Ruby User Group (Rug::B)</a>, will travel over the North Sea to present at the <a href='http://scotrug.org/'>Scottish Ruby User Group</a> in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Martin Rehfeld will be talking about the lessons learned developing his new service Assets.io. Moving parts involve apart from Cloudfront &amp; EC2 a custom backend using evented Ruby code (Thin/Async Rack/Eventmachine).</p>

<p>The speaker exchange program is looking for some sponsorship, particularly to cover Martinâ€™s cost. If your company can help, get in touch via the <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/usergroup-speaker-exchange'>Google Group</a> or email thilo $at$ upstre $dot$ am.</p>
