<p>The Ruby User Group Speaker Exchange connects Ruby User Groups throughout Europe. What does this mean?</p>

<ul>
<li>Enable traveling Rubyists to get in touch with local user groups at their destination to join their meetups and encourage them to present as well.</li>

<li>Connect speakers that like to present their topic to other user groups with local organizers and prospect sponsors to get support for travel expanses.</li>

<li>Encourage underrepresented groups to present abroad by funding their trips.</li>

<li>Build speaker confidence by giving inexperienced speakers the opportunity to talk to a international audience before appearing at big conferences.</li>

<li>Bring the Ruby community closer together by providing a means for contact and exchanging ideas.</li>

<li>Making user groups more attractive to new members by bringing more diversity</li>
</ul>

<p>We already have established connections with Ruby communities in Edinburgh (Paul Wilson), London (Murray Steele) and Barcelona (Christian Amor).</p>

<p>As a matter of fact you <em>SHOULD</em> remove it! Really! Or must I <strong>bold</strong> this?</p>
