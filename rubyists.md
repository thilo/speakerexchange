The Ruby User Group Speaker Exchange connects Ruby User Groups throughout Europe. What does this mean? 

- Enable traveling Rubyists to get in touch with local user groups at their destination to join their meetups and encourage them to present as well.
- Connect speakers that like to present their topic to other user groups with local organizers and prospect sponsors to get support for travel expanses.
- Encourage underrepresented groups to present abroad by funding their trips.
- Build speaker confidence by giving inexperienced speakers the opportunity to talk to a international audience before appearing at big conferences.
- Bring the Ruby community closer together by providing a means for contact and exchanging ideas.
- Making user groups more attractive to new members by bringing more diversity

We already have established connections with Ruby communities in Edinburgh (Paul Wilson), London (Murray Steele) and Barcelona (Christian Amor).
