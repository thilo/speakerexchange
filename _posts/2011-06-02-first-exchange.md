In June Martin Rehfeld, member of the [Ruby User Group (Rug::B)](http://rug-b.de), will travel over the North Sea to present at the [Scottish Ruby User Group](http://scotrug.org/) in Edinburgh. 

Martin Rehfeld will be talking about the lessons learned developing his new service Assets.io. Moving parts involve apart from Cloudfront & EC2 a custom backend using evented Ruby code (Thin/Async Rack/Eventmachine). 

Thanks to the awesome people at [EdgeCase](http://edgecase.com/), a premium software consultancy based in Edinburgh, Martins flight costs are covered. Hooray!
